The "db" folder implements a simple hierarchical database for course enrollment. Finish the to-dos in [hdm.py](src/hdm.py) and enable users to: 

* list all courses; 
* list all sections of a course; 
* list all students enrolled in a course section; and 
* list all course sections that a student is enrolled in.
